This template is built off of the base [Dev Container Python template](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/python) and adds extensions and features for system tools that can help with secure code development on Azure.

> NOTE: the template turns off auto port forwarding, if you are running into issues with this you can figure out what ports you do need and explictly open them with `forwardPorts` [docs](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/#general-properties).
